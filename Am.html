      Dear Nehil, <br><br>
      I don't know how to start this, 
      You coming into my life is obviously the best thing that has ever happened to me. Your existence makes my day complete.
      With you I found endless love, comfort and laughter. At one point I had given up on love, which is when I met you and I'm so glad I did, I wouldn't have been able to achieve anything that I have if it weren't for you being there. I owe all my sucess to you. Baby all my love that I can ever give, I want to give it to you because you are a really precious person who deserves all the love that every human on the planet can give. You are what I prayed for and you mean the world to me so much so that I know that I can't imagine existing a day without you. You've made life liveable honey.
      No matter what, Iâ€™ll always treasure us, our moments, and the way you make me feel at home in your heart.ðŸ’• <br><br>
      Always yours, <br>
      AmshuðŸ’•
